# Survival-analysis-of-heart-failure-patients

This project centers on conducting survival analysis among patients with heart failure. Specifically, the study targets individuals aged 40 years or older diagnosed with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The objective is to investigate the correlation and interactions among various factors, including age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium levels, presence of anemia, platelet count, creatinine phosphokinase levels, blood pressure, gender, diabetes status, and smoking habits, as potential contributors to mortality outcomes.
